#### Bits
- *Bits* are electrical impulses that represent either a 0 or 1
- When combined in a sequence (sent over [[Layer 1|Layer 1]] in a **bitstream**), they can represent complex values

#### Hex
- A Base-16 numbering numbering that ranges from *0 (zero)* to *F (15)*
- 8 *bits* = 2 *hex digits* = 1 *byte*
- Number strings are differentiated with *0y*, where *y* signifies the kind of number
	- EXAMPLE: The *IPv6 Type* in an [[802.3 Frames|802.3 Frame]]

- Binary, Decimal, and Hexadecimal
	- When working with [[MAC Address|MAC addresses]] and [[IPv6]] addresses, each digit is represented by 4 *binary bits* (also called *hextets*, pieces, or quartets)

| Binary | Decimal | Hexadecimal |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| 1010   | 10      | A           |
| 1011   | 11      | B           |
| 1100   | 12      | C           |
| 1101   | 13      | D           |
| 1110   | 14      | E           |
| 1111   | 15      | F           |





# Trivia (definitely not on the CCNA)
Apparently, 4 bits is called a nibble (or nybble, nyble, nybl) (get it? Because byte = bite, so half a bite is a nibble), so a hex digit could be called a nibble.
