#### CSMA/CS
*Carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD)* is used for detecting and recovering from [[Collision Domain|collisions]]. It is a Medium Access Control ([[MAC Address|MAC]]) sublayer method that uses carrier-sensing to defer transmissions until no other stations are transmitting.
