#### MAC Address
A **Media Access Control** address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (*NIC*) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment, functional at [[Layer 2|Layer 2]].
- Ethernet uses 48-bit hexadecimal MAC addresses
	- First 24 bits is the *Organizationally Unique Identifier* (**OUI**), assigned to the *manufacturer* by the [[IEEE]]
	- Last 24 bits are *vender assigned*
- Also known as a **Burned In Address (BIA)** when physically configured by the manufacturer
	- Every burned in MAC address is unique
		- Not logical (i.e., configured by software protocols on the device)
	- MAC addresses can also be manually configured by an administrator
