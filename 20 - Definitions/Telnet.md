#### Telnet
- *Telnet* is an archaic, unsecure *virtual terminal* protocol that was usurped by [[SSH]].
	- *All information* (including usernames and passwords) are communicated in *plain text*, which means anyone sniffing network information can read it.
	- However, because it's incredibly simple to setup and use, it is still sometimes used for [[Diagnostic Commands|diagnostic]] or low-risk situations
