#### Idempotence
- *Idempotence* is the property of certain operations where they can be applied multiple times without changing the results beyond the initial application
	- Examples:
		- 1x1=1
		- A pair of On and Off buttons, where pressing each button sets a gate to either open or closed, and pressing a button more than once in a row doesn't make the gate more closed or more open
- from *idem* + *potence* (same + power)
