#### Hub
- *Hubs* are [[Layer 1|Layer 1]] multi-port repeaters that forward (i.e. [[Broadcast Address|broadcast]]) signals to all active ports
	- Used for connecting multiple [[Ethernet]] devices together and making them act as a single network segment.
- Hubs operate in [[Half-Duplex]] mode and **share the same [[Collision Domain]]
- Not [[MAC Address|MAC]] address aware; whenever a [[802.3 Frames|Frame]] is received, it is flooded out all ports apart from the one it was received on
- Hosts connected through a hub use [[CSMA-CD|CSMA/CD]] to detect collisions and resend frames
