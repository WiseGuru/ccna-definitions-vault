#### Collisions
- *Collisions* occur when two or more devices attempt to send a packet simultaneously over the same [[Collision Domain]] (e.g., a [[Hub]], [[Half-Duplex]] link, etc.)
- Collisions can be avoided on [[Half-Duplex]] connections by using [[CSMA-CD|CSMA/CD]] (on wired networks) or [[CSMA-CA|CSMA/CA]] (on wireless networks)
- Additionally, [[Full-Duplex]] links are able to send and receive data simultaneously, preventing collisions
