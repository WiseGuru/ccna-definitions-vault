#### CIDR
*Classless Inter-Domain Routing* is a method for allocating IP addresses and for IP routing.

It is based on Variable-Length Subnet Masking ([[VLSM]]), in which network prefixes have variable length (as opposed to fixed-length prefixing of the classful network design).

CIDR notation uses a slash to describe the [[IP subnet|subnet]]. For example, 192.168.51.100/24 instead of 192.168.51.100 255.255.255.0
