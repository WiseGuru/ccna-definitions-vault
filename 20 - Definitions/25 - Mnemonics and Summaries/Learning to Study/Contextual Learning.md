#### Contextual Learning
- *Contextual Learning* focuses on relating *educational content* to *real-world* situations, forming stronger neural connections
- The short idea is *the more you do with it, the better you learn it*
	- Learning in multiple contexts (labs, flash cards, problem solving, etc.) strengthen the mental connections we make


I asked ChatGPT for ways to help integrate *Contextual Learning* into studying for a technical certification, and here's what it gave me.
1. **Identify Real-World Applications**:
	1. Start by understanding how the topics covered in the certification are used in practical scenarios.
	2. For instance, if youâ€™re studying for a cybersecurity certification, investigate how different security principles are applied in the prevention of real-world cyber attacks.
2. **Case Studies**:
	1. Include case studies in your study routine.
		1. These provide concrete examples of how concepts have been applied successfully or have failed, in real situations.
	2. Analyzing these can deepen your understanding and give you insights into the practical implications of your study material.
3. **Simulations and Labs**:
	1. Engage in hands-on labs and simulations that mimic real-world systems and scenarios.
	2. This could involve setting up security protocols on a network or configuring a virtual environment that mirrors an actual IT infrastructure.
4. **Problem-Based Learning**:
	1. Tackle problems that professionals in the field might face.
	2. This method encourages you to apply your knowledge to solve specific issues, which aids in reinforcing what you've learned and understanding its practical relevance.
5. **Discussion and Collaboration**:
	1. Join study groups or online forums where you can discuss the certification topics with peers.
	2. Explaining concepts to others and hearing how they apply these in different contexts can broaden your understanding and provide new perspectives.
6. **Relate to Current Events**:
	1. Connect what you're learning with current events or recent developments in the field.
		1. For example, relate a study topic to a recent cybersecurity breach or technological advance.
	2. This not only makes the material more engaging but also keeps you updated with the industry.
7. **Teach What You Learn**:
	1. Try to explain or teach the new concepts to someone else.
	2. Teaching is a powerful method to deepen your own understanding and discover any gaps in your knowledge.
