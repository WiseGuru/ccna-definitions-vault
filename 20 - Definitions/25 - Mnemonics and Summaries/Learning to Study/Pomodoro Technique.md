#### Pomodoro Technique
- The *Pomodoro Technique* is^[In the context of this article and site] a *time-blocking* studying technique that breaks up periods of *rigorous*, *focused* study with short periods of *intense mental rest*.
	- In my experience, I have retained more information over a shorter period of time and ended my study sessions with more optimistic and with more mental energy than regular studying.
- *Here's the technique:*
	- Write down your intention for the study period (optional)
		- This is particularly helpful if you are struggling to get started or re-start (e.g., 5 minute break + coffee)
		- I find I don't always need to do this, but it can be very helpful
	- 25-30 minutes of highly-focused studying
		- Clear idea of what you are going to focus on or accomplish during this period
		- No Reddit, no music, no Reels, phone on silent if possible
	- 5-10 minutes of low-stimulus rest
		- Eyes closed, quiet, no new external information entering your mind
		- You can daydream or meditate
			- Personally, I alternate to keep it interesting
	- Repeat the above up to 4 times
		- On the 4th break, extend it to 15-30 minutes of rest.
- *Here's how it works:*
	- Our brains need short periods of rest to process and store information properly
		- There are tons of studies^[[An Effortless Way to Improve Your Memory](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/an-effortless-way-to-improve-your-memory)] that demonstrate the dramatic effect rest has on retaining learned information
		- A study by psychologists Muller and Pilzecker in 1900 asked participants to recall items in two lists.
			- The control group had no time to rest between studying the lists
				- They were able to recall (on average) about *28% of the first list*
			- The experimental group had 6 minutes or so of rest between studying
				- The people with a short rest could recall about *50% of the first list*
	- Hypothetical example: 
		- *Think of your brain like a library.*
			- The *shelves* are your *long-term memory*
			- The *librarians* are your *working memory*
			- The *patrons* are *tasks* that require you to *recall* or *learn* new information
		- Normally, patrons come and go without a lot of fuss
			- Sometimes patrons come in to check out books (*recall*), sometimes they drop off donations (*learn*)
			- The librarians have to manage the requests and donations, and most of the time it's pretty easy
		- *Studying* is like *many patrons* donating *tons of books* all at once
			- *The books pile up* at the front desk, and the *librarians are overwhelmed*
			- Maybe they don't file them correctly, maybe another patron takes a book, maybe Giorgio just throws away a bunch of them to clear the desk.
		- Introducing *a short rest allows the librarians to file the books properly* before the next wave of books come
