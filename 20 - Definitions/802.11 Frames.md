### 802.11 Frame Format
![[802.11 Frames-1.png]]

| 2 bytes            | 2 bytes     | 6 bytes   | 6 bytes   | 6 bytes   | 2 bytes          | 6 bytes   | 2 bytes     | 4 bytes    | variable size     | 4 bytes |
| ------------------ | ----------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ---------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| Frame Control (FC) | Duration/ID | Address 1 | Address 2 | Address 3 | Sequence Control | Address 4 | QoS Control | HT Control | Data (Frame Body) | FCS     |

- Frame Control **(FC)**
	- Message type and subtype
- Duration/ID **(DUR)**
	- EITHER the time in microseconds the channel will be dedicated for transmission of the frame
	- OR an identifier for the connection (association)
- Addresses **(ADD1-4)**
	- Up to 4 address can be included, though which ones and their order varies
		- Destination address (DA) - Final recipient
		- Source Address (SA) - Original sender
		- Receiver Address (RA) - Immediate recipient
		- Transmitter address (TA) - Immediate sender
	- NOTE: the *4th* address is only present when communicating with devices on the [[Distribution System (DS)]]
		- Computers, servers, other APs, etc.
- Sequence Control **(SEQ)**
	- Used to reassemble fragments and eliminate duplicate frames
- QoS Control **(QOS)**
	- Used to prioritize certain traffic
- HT (High Throughput) Control **(HT/HTC)**
	- Added to 802.11n to enable High Throughput operations
		- 802.11n is also known as HT Wi-Fi
		- 802.11ac is also known as Very HT (VHT) Wi-Fi
- Frame Body **(DATA)**
	- You know what it is
- FCS (frame check sequence) **(FCS)**
	- Same as ethernet header, checks for errors

Fuck DurID 123 Seek 4 Cuz Hate Data FUCKS

1. FC and DUR(ation)/ID are first
2. Addresses 1, 2, 3 SEQ 4 (1 2 3 SEEK 4)
3. ??? (QoS and HT)
4. PROFIT: DATA and FCS come last
5. HT FCS (Hate Fucks) are 4 bytes, Addresses are 6 bytes, the rest are 2 bytes
