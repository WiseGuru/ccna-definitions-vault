#### Copper UTP
Copper Untwisted Pair cables (ethernet cables)
- Can support Power over Ethernet ([[PoE]])
- can be wired to an RJ-45 connector either as straight-through or crossover

### Maybe Not CCNA Relevant
- There are 4 wire pairs in a *UTP* cable, with each cable in a colored pair either *solid* or *striped*
	- Orange
	- Blue
	- Green
	- Brown
- In *traditional [[Ethernet]]* (10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX, or *Ethernet* and *Fast Ethernet*), only TWO out of the four available pairs are used for data transfer
- In 1000BASE-T (Gigabit) and above, all 4 pairs are used
