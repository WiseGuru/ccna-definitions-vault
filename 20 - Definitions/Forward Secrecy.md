#### Forward Secrecy
- Prevents Data from being decrypted after it was transmitted over the air
- Session keys are generated from a long-term [[PSK|Pre-Shared Key]] that is discarded after the session ends
	- Even if the attack obtains the session key, it cannot be used to decrypt past or future sessions
