#### SSID
- The *Service Set Identifier (SSID)* is the human-readable name of a [[802.11|Wireless Network]]
- Unlike a [[BSSID]], it does not have to be unique
- Multiple wireless networks can be configured with the same *SSID* to allow devices to roam between [[Wireless Access Points|APs]] through [[Wireless Service Sets|ESS]]
