I published most of my CCNA notes using Ole's [GitHub - oleeskild/digitalgarden](https://github.com/oleeskild/digitalgarden) and [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). There are a couple of guides out there on this, but few of them actually solved my problems with Cloudflare specifically, so here you go!

Until I actually get around to it, here's a link to the guide I used initially, but ran into problems with: [How I Published My Knowledge Base Online for Free](https://sharaf.cc/40-49-toolbox/40-note-taking/40-01-obsidian/guides/publish-obsidian-vault-for-free/)

The *KEY* when publishing to Cloudflare is the **Build Configuration**. Specifically, I changed the "_build output directory_" from `/src/site` to `/dist`.

![[How this site was made-1.png]]

After that, I went into Obsidian to push some changes, and it was up and running! I had to tweak the settings a little bit to get them all showing correctly, but as you can see, everything is running fine.

## Steps to Publish Cloudflare (WIP)
1. Download and install the Obsidian community plugin
2. Create a GitHub account (if you don't already have one).
3. Create a Cloudflare account.
4. Go to [this repo](https://github.com/oleeskild/digitalgarden) and click "*Use this Template*," and select "*Create a new repository*"
	1. ![[How this site was made-4.png]]
	2. NOTE: If you don't see it, you may need to either maximize the page or zoom out.
5. Configure the new repo
	1. I don't believe you need to copy all branches.
		1. In fact, in my testing, it causes some problems (that can be easily overcome, but still)... best to stay away
	2. Enter a name and description for the repository
	3. Set the repository as *Public* or *Private*
		1. I don't think this should have any impact on the how the repo functions, since you give explicit permission to everything
	4. Example configuration: 
	   ![[How this site was made-5.png]]
6. Create an access token to the Repo for Digital Garden^[ oleeskild's guide to create a [fine grained access token](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/advanced/fine-grained-access-token/)]
	1. Click on your profile icon at the top-right corner
	2. Select "*Settings*"
	3. In the left bar, select "*Developer Settings*"
	4. In the left bar, expand "*Personal access tokens*" and select "*Fine-grained tokens*"
	5. Click "*Generate new token*"
	6. Enter the following information:
		1. Main settings
			1. Token name
			2. Token expiration date
				1. Cannot go further than a year.
				2. Once a token expires, it will need to be regenerated.
				3. IIRC, you can just reactivate the token, but you may need to copy/paste the token back into the plugin.
		2. Repository Access
			1. "*Only select repositories*" and select the repository
		3. Repository Permissions
			1. *Contents*: Read and write
			2. *Pull Requests*: Read and write
	7. Generate token - **DO NOT EXIT THIS PAGE**
		1. This is the only time on GitHub that you will be able to see this token
		2. Feel free to save it to your preferred password manager or copy it right into the Obsidian plugin
7. Configure the Digital Garden plugin in Obsidian
	1. I recommend making all the changes you want to make now if you can, before adding Cloudflare as the publisher.
	2. Some observations I've made:
		1. I like turning almost all of the Features on
			1. Excluding Frontmatter, which can break the site
		2. Under appearance, I change the theme to match my current theme so I know what it will look like
		3. Set a site name
		4. Favicon needs to be an svg file and square
			1. If you update the Favicon after you create your site, you may need to purge your browser's cache before you will see it reflected
		5. WARNING: Add Timestamps to pages
			1. When I did this, it brought down CCNAdefinitions, so I will need to experiment with another site until I can get it working.
8. Create some content
	1. Set up a homepage and configure it to publish
	   ![[How this site was made-10.png|250]]
		1. You must have ONE homepage with a checkbox
		2. Every page you wish to publish must have this flag enabled 
	2. When ready, *Publish all notes* from the command pane
	   ![[How this site was made-11.png]]
9. Configure Cloudflare
	1. Log in to Cloudflare, expand the left menu bar, expand *Workers and Pages*, select *Overview*, and click *Create Application*
	   ![[How this site was made-6.png]]
	2. Connect it to your GIT account
	   ![[How this site was made-7.png]]
		1. NOTE: If you've done this before, you'll have to select "*Add account*" for the new repo to appear 
		   ![[How this site was made-8.png|500]]
	3. Configure the deployment 
	   ![[How this site was made-9.png|500]]
		1. Enter the project name (default is the Repo name)
		2. Set production branch to *Main*
		3. Leave the *Framework* preset as default or set to *Eleventy*
			1. I don't think this matters, as we immediately change the commands afterward
		4. Set the *Build command* to `npm run build`
		5. Set the *Build output directory*
10. Configure Security and Dependency Updates in GitHub
	1. **NOTE**: If you apply updates through Dependabot, *Digital Garden* updates overwrite them, and you may be required to re-apply them.
	2. In the Repo, navigate to "*Settings*," *Code security and analysis*, and enable Dependabot *Alerts* and *Security Updates*
		1. ![[How this site was made-12.png]]
		2. When there is a dependency update or security issue, Dependabot will create a pull request, and Cloudflare will test the build in a preview to make sure it builds correctly.
			1. ![[How this site was made-13.png]]
		3. To merge the pull request, click the *green button above* and then click *confirm merge*
			1. ![[How this site was made-14.png]]
	3. This is strongly recommended; familiarize yourself with *Visual Studio Code*, Node.js, and *GitHub Desktop*
		1. Sometimes you gotta fix dependencies yourself for security updates, boy howdy, knowing how those work are key.
			1. Relevant: [Package.json vs Package-lock.json](https://www.atatus.com/blog/package-json-vs-package-lock-json/)
		2. You thought you were signing up for some free and easy way to upload your notes to the internet? Well with great power comes great security risks, and if you don't want some script kiddie owning your base, you should assume the people making free tools have overlooked something.
12. Add other security features
	1. From [your Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com), select your site. From the main panel or left column, choose:
		1. Quick Start Guide
			1. Click "*Review Settings*" in the *Quick Start Guide* pane
				1. ![[How this site was made-15.png]]
			2. Enable Automatic HTTPS rewrites
			3. Enable *Always Use HTTPS*
			4. Your choice whether to enable or disable Brotli compression; I couldn't find anything indicating it was insecure to use, and is apparently a [A Fast Alternative to GZIP Compression](https://kinsta.com/blog/brotli-compression/)
		2. SSL/TLS
			6. In the left column, select "*SSL/TLS*"
			7. Under "*Overview*", select "*Full (Strict)*"
				1. If you're squeamish, choose "*Full*"
				2. Because the whole site is hosted on Cloudflare, you shouldn't have to create any additional certificates
			8. Under "*Edge Certificates*"
				1. Enable "*HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)*";^[[HSTS Preload List Submission](https://hstspreload.org)]^[[The HTTPS-Only Standard - HTTP Strict Transport Security](https://https.cio.gov/hsts/)] this brings up a big scary menu. Check the box and click *Next*, and choose the options in the following menu:
					1. Enable HSTS
					2. Max Age - 1 Year
						1. Required for *Preload*
					3. Enable Apply HSTS Policy to Subdomains
					4. Enable Preload
					5. Enable No-Sniff Header
				2. Set "*Minimum TLS Version*" to *TLS 1.3* (or minimum *TLS 1.2*)
					1. The default *TLS 1.0* is busted, and *TLS 1.1* was deprecated in 2021.
					2. *TLS 1.2* is less secure and slower than *1.3*, but you may have a use-case for needing it. However, that's unlikely for this kind of site.
		3. Security
			1. Security level: *Low* or *Medium*
				1. Choose what level of visitors should receive a *Challenge* (like a CAPTCHA or similar) if they are deemed sufficiently threatening
				2. Default is *Essentially Off*, and going from *Low* to *High* increases the likelihood of suspicious visitors getting prompted
				3. I would advocate *Medium* and doing some testing from different browsers, using a VPN, etc., and downgrading if you feel it's necessary
			2. Challenge Passage: *Your preference* (Default 30 minutes)
				1. If a suspicious visitor gets past the challenge, this dictates how frequently they are re-challenged
				2. *Default* is *30* *minutes*, and based on your testing for Security Level (e.g., if it trips when you're using a VPN), I would set the time period higher^[Life of a Tor user : r/TOR](https://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/comments/187rfbh/life_of_a_tor_user/)
	2. Headers
		1. Cloudflare allows you to install custom headers^[[Headers Â· Cloudflare Pages docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/headers/)] into your site
			1. **This is critical**, as it can improve your site's security and reduce the likelihood of your visitors getting owned.
			2. **NOTE**: I anticipate these headers will get overwritten when the *Digital Garden* releases an update, so you will have to re-apply them each time.
			3. You can check your site's headers and see ways to remediate security issues with [Analyse your HTTP response headers](https://securityheaders.com)
		2. To add security headers, create a file called `_headers`^[Not `_headers.txt`, not `headers`, and for godsake not `TheseAreMySecurityHeadersForMyCloudflareSite.txt.xml.zip.tar.gz`] in the folder "/src/site"
			1. Enter the following code: 
				1. ![[Cloudflare Headers]]
				2. **NOTE**: The *Content-Security-Policy* is in *Report Only* mode because right now it's busting my site when I apply it. I'm trying to find what else needs to get added so that everything works, but right now it's in *Report Only mode*.
					1. It worked for one of my other sites, but not **CCNA Definitions**, so I'm going to have to do some troubleshooting... 
				3. To view my current added headers (and see if I forgot to update this page), you can go [here](https://github.com/WiseGuru/ccna-definitions/blob/main/src/site/_headers).
		3. To verify that your headers have been added, under "*Deployment Details*", you can click on the *Headers* tab and see what was added
			1. Successful addition of headers
				1. ![[How this site was made-16.png]]
			2. Failed addition of headers
				1. ![[How this site was made-17.png]]
13. Troubleshooting
	1. You see a bunch of Failed deployments in Cloudflare to "Filetree"
		1. Make sure the *Main* branch is set as "Default" in GitHub
