Welcome to WiseGuru's *community-driven* site of **CCNA Definitions**! The goal of this is a living document is to provide you with *concise*, *relevant definitions* for any topic you might encounter on the **CCNA**. This is not a replacement for an *instructor-led course* or the [Cisco OCG](https://www.ciscopress.com/store/ccna-200-301-official-cert-guide-library-9781587147142), but should help reinforce what you've learned.

This is (and always will be) a **work in progress**, and as such, it will have *incomplete* or *incorrect* information. I started this database of definitions in 2023 part-way through my own CCNA studies, and so some entries were never updated beyond creation or were never created at all.

### Add these notes directly to your Obsidian Vault
If you would like a copy of these notes **directly** in your [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) **vault**, now you can! Just go to [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/WiseGuru/ccna-definitions-vault), click on the "Code" dropdown menu, and download it as a *zip* file. Extract the folders and copy/paste them into your vault, and you should be good to go!

If you have any problems, let me know either through this [Google Forms Survey](https://forms.gle/HmYY8zjdgzJQFiWr5), or by submitting an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/WiseGuru/ccna-definitions-vault/issues/new).

You can also [[How to fork this repository|fork this repository]] and use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to synchronize changes. I hope to be posting instructions soon on how to do this.

# Help me make this better

You can help! If you find any information that is incorrect or incomplete (*within the scope of the CCNA*), PLEASE submit a ticket on **GitHub** with a *correction* and *source*. I will update the page and add a link to your profile (either GitHub or another service you specify) on the page as a contributor.

There are *two ways* you can submit information; either through this [Google Forms Survey](https://forms.gle/HmYY8zjdgzJQFiWr5), or by submitting an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/WiseGuru/ccna-definitions-vault/issues/new).
- Please note that any information submitted via the **Google Form** is *anonymous*, ONE-WAY communication; **I will not be able to follow up with you** to answer questions, seek clarification, or update you on the status of the request.

When submitting new information, I would appreciate it if followed this [[Style Guide|Style Guide/Template]], but it's not necessary. Thank you!
### Project Goals
If you're familiar with *GitHub* and *Obsidian* markdown editor, I am trying to streamline a process for other students to access these definitions within their own vault. If you have ideas on how this might be accomplished, please reach out to me!


## Unoriginal Content
During my studies, I used [Jeremy's IT Lab Free CCNA Complete Course 2023](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ) and Neil Anderson's [Complete CCNA Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ccna-complete/) as my primary sources, and used [Boson ExSim to practice for the exam](https://exams.boson.com/exams). While I have gone through and tried to remove any duplicated information from their courses, I am sure I have missed some. Please report any unoriginal information to me, and I will replace it with original content.
